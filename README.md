# BEP20-Honeypot-Token

BEP-20 Honeypot smart contract Sourcecode for use on the Binance Smart Chain Network. 

BEP20-Honeypot-Token is a Token that doesn't allow Buyers to Sell or Swap it (TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED).

Note: This honeypot has been successful in over 100 token launches, I have made 100x our liquidity on multiple launches.

I have a method that works rinse and repeat and it does not matter how many other tokens are doing this.
